This is a multi-part assignment.

The pulldown on the upper left lets you select
which part you are working on.

The runcase shell script is provided to allow you
to run just a single test case.

If you type "runcase" you will get a list of all the
test cases, and what arguments are used for each case.

If you type "runcase X" you will run only one case.
For example, "runcase file6" will run test case "file6".

DO NOT EDIT THE RUNCASE FILE

IMPORTANT: runcase does not compile your program. If you
make changes, press BUILD before typing runcase.

All test cases are in the .tar.gz file; you can download them
to your own machine if you like.
